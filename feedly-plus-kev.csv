1. Implement the principle of least privilege to limit the potential impact of successful exploits.
2. Use application whitelisting to prevent unauthorized applications from running.
3. Keep all Windows systems and software up-to-date with the latest security patches.

1. Confidentiality: HIGH - An attacker could read sensitive data from any part of physical memory.
2. Integrity: HIGH - An attacker could modify data in any part of physical memory, potentially altering system behavior or injecting malicious code.
3. Availability: HIGH - Arbitrary writes to physical memory could crash the system or cause data corruption.

This indicates:
- Attack Vector (AV): Local, requiring the attacker to have prior access to the system.
- Attack Complexity (AC): Low, suggesting the attack is relatively easy to perform.
- Privileges Required (PR): Low, meaning the attacker needs some privileges, but not administrative access.
